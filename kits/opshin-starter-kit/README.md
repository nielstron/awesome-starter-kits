OpShin Starter-kit

This Starter-Kit is a small tutorial of how to use the PyCardano library with opshin for interacting with a simple vesting contract on Cardano.

PyCardano is a Cardano library written in Python. It allows users to create and sign transactions without depending on third-party Cardano serialization tools, such as cardano-cli and cardano-serialization-lib, making it a lightweight library, which is simple and fast to set up in all types of environments.

opshin is a Smart Contract language based on Python. It allows users to define and compile Smart Contracts directly within a python environment. It also interacts seemlessly with PyCardano.
